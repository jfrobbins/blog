Lately I've started finding [Bitmessage](https://www.bitmessage.org/wiki/Main_Page) interesting again. I used it a little early on, but haven't in a year or so.

After recovering my address, I've been back on the network and I'm remembering that I really like the idea of it--mostly the simplicity! 
Compared to GPG, this is no contest that almost anyone could use this. [Some people](http://www.thoughtcrime.org/blog/gpg-and-me/) feel that [GPG is damn near unusable](http://mirror.us.oneandone.net/projects/media.ccc.de/congress/2014/h264-hd/31c3-6021-en-de-Why_is_GPG_damn_near_unusable_hd.mp4), 
and while I don't really agree, according to the guy in that talk I (and probably you) are considered the "technological elite."

There is also a deamon client that can be used for cli access via the api, which is very useful to keep running on a server and access remotely through ssh.

For subscriptions, there is a BitM DevTalk address: `BM-2D9QKN4teYRvoq2fyzpiftPh9WP9qggtzh` (not sure whether it is ML or BC).


My BM address can be found on the [contact page](/pages/contact.html), or at the time of this writing it is `BM-2cXfajwDHoCYegdYu2o83Uy8tY1BESzszN`

* [PyBitmessage github](https://github.com/Bitmessage/PyBitmessage.git)
* [PyBitmessage daemon](https://git.jrobb.org/jrobb/PyBitmessage-Daemon)

Now, I'm off to [read](https://bitmessage.org/bitmessage.pdf) some more details about the [protocol specification](https://bitmessage.org/wiki/Protocol_specification) that is used, and more about the [encryption](https://bitmessage.org/wiki/Encryption).

But at least I've finally made a blog post in 2015!
