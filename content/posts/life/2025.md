# 2025 Self-Goals
I meant to make this post yesterday on new year's day, but I didn't get around to it.  So January 2nd it is :-)

As the new year dawns, the traditional notion of "New Year's resolutions" often comes with a connotation of grandiose promises that are hard to keep. 

Instead, I've decided to focus on **goals** - tangible, achievable targets that can guide personal growth throughout the year. 

## The question

The question I asked myself at the beginning of 2025 was simple yet profound: 

> *What would I like to accomplish this year?* 

Here's my roadmap for personal development:

### Be a Better Husband and Cultivate a Happy, Healthy Relationship
- **Objective:** Work hand-in-hand with my wife to strengthen our bond, ensuring we both feel loved, supported, and heard.
- **Action Plan:** Regular date nights, open communication sessions, and perhaps a couple's retreat if feasible.

### Weight Loss Journey
- **Current Weight:** Around 240 lbs
- **Goal Weight:** 215 lbs by July
- **Strategy:** Incorporate a balanced diet, regular exercise (aim for 3-4 times a week), keep myself accountable.

This is part of a larger effort to be and stay healthy.

### Intellectual Growth Through Reading
- **Goal:** Read 4 books this year, translating to at least one book every three months.
- **Selection:** Focus on a mix of fiction and non-fiction to broaden perspectives and entertain.

I have a lot of personal development type books, but I need to make sure to balance in some "fun" ones in order to be successful.

### Quality Time with My Children
- **Aim:** To be more involved and spend more quality time with my kids.
- **Activities:** Plan weekly family activities, be present at their school events, and engage in their hobbies or interests.

Time is fleeting, and they are growing up fast. It won't be too much longer until they want to hang out with us even less than they do already.

### Embracing Nature with Camping
- **Goal:** Camp at least once, with an ideal target of twice.
- **Plan:** Find local or not-too-distant camping sites, involve the whole family in planning, and make it a memorable outdoor experience.

Being outside is good for the soul.

## Wrap-up

By setting goals rather than resolutions, I'm not just envisioning a life filled with love, health, knowledge, and adventure; I'm committing to realistic, step-by-step changes that can truly enhance my life in 2025 and beyond.
