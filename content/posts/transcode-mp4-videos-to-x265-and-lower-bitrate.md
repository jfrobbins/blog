Yesterday at work I needed to send some video files, however they were _huge_. 
I used ffmpeg to transcode the files to H.265 and lowered the bitrate until they were an acceptable size -- 
I did this manually on the CLI a few times, and since there were several files in the directory I quickly tired of that.

So of course I needed a script to walk through the dir and do this for me!
I used ChatGPT to create the script once I had the commands how I wanted them. :-)
- [here](https://chatgpt.com/share/6752fc65-1f94-8009-9c93-755aa0bf5407) is a link to the prompts I used to create the source file.

Here is my github gist with documentation, source, etc:
- https://gist.github.com/jfrobbins/0f8ef94b1a7ff780f74a320a2fd9530c

As I tried different CRF values to change the bitrate, the filesize changed drastically.
From the gist above, here's a table showing some example changes based on CRF values:

## CRF value vs filesize
| CRF | Filesize |
| --- | ----- |
| -   | 482.6 MB |
| 30  |  56.5 MB |
| 35  |  21.3 MB |
| 40  |   9.5 MB |

## other useful info:

> Using the H.265 codec, we can compress the video more for the same quality (vs H.264), or gives higher quality for the same size. 
> 
> Push the compression lever further by **increasing** the CRF value â€” a reasonable range for H.265 may be `24` to `30`.   
> 
> Even **higher CRF values will reduce filesize further**, but sacrifices quality (depending on the video and goals).
> 
> Note that **lower CRF values correspond to higher bitrates**, and hence produce higher quality videos.

# python script

And lastly, here is the source for the script:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
"""
transcode_mp4_files_x265.py

A script to batch transcode .mp4 files using FFmpeg with configurable CRF values.
