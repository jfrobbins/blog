<h3>My introduction to the Internet</h3>

I started out creating websites for myself and friends on geocities and other hosts that were similar back in the day (late 90s). Gradually I learned and came across new technologies, data formats, and programming languages.

Back in the summer of 2000, I had just graduated high school, the Internet was in what I consider its "prime", and I was running way too many websites. They were all mostly silly or pointless, and I wanted to drop them all as I thought that did not make sense and was a waste of time.  After thinking it over for a while, I created <strong>factorQ.net</strong>, and have utilized it on and off since then. 
The name does not mean or stand for anything in particular, I just thought of a "cool sounding" name....and factorq.com was a russian porn site--doh! 
So .Net it was. Before the whole blogging thing got overly popular and [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org") became the golden standard, I got tired of editing plain html and actually set up my MySQL db and created a php site that could handle dynamic content very well. I still maintain that I was ahead of my time and if I had stuck with it I could have created and distributed my own <a title="content management system" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system" target="_blank">CMS</a> like Wordpress, but hindsight is 20/20.
Around this same time period, I was also introduced to Linux by [a friend]({< ref "posts/archive/2011-01-05-WeBreezes.md" >}).

For a long stretch of time, probably from 2003 or 2004 until the summer of 2009 the factorq.net domain was lost and other domains were used-- in 2009 I reattained the domain.

Over the years I have gone from a [paid host](http://www.hostrocket.com/"), to a [free host](https://x10hosting.com), [Blogger](https://factorq.blogspot.com), and now to [wordpress](http://wordpress.com/) (see [this post](blog/index.php?article=43) for backstory). And now (January 3, 2011) I 
have actually switched back to a paid server with more HTML based content (I didn't want to pay the extra carge for a db)...a custom php front side and the blog
is [my own fork of hl--](http://jbs.jrobb.org).  Once I get it sorted, it should all be able to be based off the blog software, I'm not sure if I want to do that yet though.
