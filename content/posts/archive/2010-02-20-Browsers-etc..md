I had used[ firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) for a long time, and then recently started using [chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) / [chromium](http://code.google.com/chromium/).  It is nice in that it is faster, and load times are good.  however, it seems that it cannot properly render some sites (they are few, but they are important!). I guess I need to say that IE is just terrible (although it is the best one ever), but really isn't even an option in my opinion.

 With the release of Firefox 3.6, I have moved back to using it... and it is faster than it was before.  Not a huge difference, not chrome  fast, but faster.  Not having a lot of add-ons helps, too.  I use [AdBlock Plus](http://adblockplus.org/) and [NoScript](http://noscript.net/), which are just awesome.

 So in my opinion, chrome is nice, but firefox can edge it out with some of these add-ons, even though chrome has the speed advantage.

 ANOTHER problem I have, which happens to be the biggest problem I have, is that Google is becoming too big-brotherish.  They have [google docs](http://docs.google.com/), gmail, and a host of other services, while being stupendous also pretty much have the ability to track all of our personal information and browsing/emailing habits.  This makes them a powerful marketing/ad-sales company, but who knows what they will do with that information in the future?  That may sound a little paranoid, but too much power in a few hands is never a good idea.

 So I am going to be sticking to firefox for now.

 ...Except on my wife's netbook, it uses chrome because it needs a lighter-weight browser to run effectively.  but generally speaking, I am sticking to firefox!
