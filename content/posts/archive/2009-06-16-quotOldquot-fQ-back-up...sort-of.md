title: '"Old" fQ back up...sort of'
---

I got my web host to get everything back together.  I set up the domains and whatnot and now it's back going again.  I say "old" because it is really not all that old.  Except for the "archive" part.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">These URLs point to "Old" fQ:</span>
[old.factorq.net](http://old.factorq.net)
[oldfq.co.cc](http://oldfq.co.cc/)
[oldfactorq.co.cc](http://oldfq.co.cc/) (not yet active)
[itsatravesty.com](http://www.itsatravesty.com/) (only active through sometime in August)
[itsatravesty.co.cc](http://itsatravesty.co.cc)

<span style="font-weight:bold;">These URLs still point to this (the main site):</span>
[factorq.net](http://www.factorq.net)
[factorq.co.cc](http://factorq.co.cc)


This will be kind of up and down until I get everything stabilized completely.

Be sure to take note of the poll -----------&gt;
and give feedback in the [forums](http://fqforums.co.cc/), and you know, here as well.
