title: My First Post ... again
---

This is not truly a first post here, I am actually editing this on January 9, 2011.  
All of the factoq.net posts have been brought over here, but I numbered them +1 from the lowest...and this is the lowest article.

While all of the posts from the latest factorq.net have been imported, there were many (MANY) from the old factorq that are either lost or in archives.  Some of the archived ones I could recover, but I am not sure if I want to--they are in a MySQL DB that I had created (which would be easy enough to get to).
Some of the others were stored in a phpNuke DB...and honestly I'm not sure if I even have backups of all of those. unfortunately :-(
