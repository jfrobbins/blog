I'm glad I am not the only one that feels this way about Google:

 [Anti-Google Sentiment Reaches a Tipping Point](http://www.daniweb.com/news/story262879.html)
Since [my last topic](http://factorq.net/2010/02/22/making-backups/) was backups, and today is Backup Awareness day, here is another post about: [http://blog.i-no.de//archives/2010/02/24/index.html#e2010-02-24T20_31_15.txt](http://blog.i-no.de//archives/2010/02/24/index.html#e2010-02-24T20_31_15.txt)
This would be interesting to read from the beginning: ["Building an all-text Linux workstation"](http://lcorg.blogspot.com/2010/01/building-all-text-linux-workstation.html), current part is part 11.  I went back to find part 8 and then gave up, part 1 is back in time somewhere!
