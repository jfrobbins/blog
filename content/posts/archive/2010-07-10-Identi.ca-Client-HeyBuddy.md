title: Identi.ca Client HeyBuddy
---

I've installed and been using [HeyBuddy](http://www.jezra.net/projects/heybuddy) as a client for [identi.ca](http://identi.ca).  If you don't know what identi.ca is...it's basically an [open source](http://linuxoutlaws.com/explanation/foss) [Twitter](http://twitter.com), with more/better features.

 This thing is great, keeps me from having to use [mustard](http://identi.ca/group/mustard) on my droid, or from keeping the webpage open.  [Status.net](http://status.net) also has a desktop client, but I do not like it as well.  Besides Heybuddy is "supposedly lightweight," which is always great.

 Check it out if you get the chance.

 Heybuddy exists on [launchpad](https://launchpad.net/heybuddy) (which provides .deb and .tar.gz packages) as well as in the [ArchLinux AUR](http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=37175). [Psquid](http://rpm.psquid.net/) has an RPM available also.
