title: My top 5 Linux Distributions and runners up
---

I've been running [ArchLinux](http://archlinux.org) on my desktop for a couple of years now, but these days I am getting on that computer less and less.  Little enough that I worry that my infrequency of system updates may cause some breakage.  To-date, I have not had any problems, but it could happen.

 This desktop hosts pictures, and runs ssh, samba, and cups primarily.  So, I was considering hopping to another distro that would possibly be more stable and run for longer periods without a need for manual updates.  After some discussion on [identi.ca](http://identi.ca), I think I will be fine staying with Arch, though--I believe I can still manage to update once a month or so. :-)

 I figure I will go ahead and re-detail my top 5 favorite Linux distros while I'm thinking about it, though. These are in order of my personal preference of use from past distro-hopping adventures:


- [Arch](http://distrowatch.com/arch) ...naturally!
- [CrunchBang](http://distrowatch.com/crunchbang) - I liked this one a lot the last time I tried it, and apparently now it is based off Debian instead of Ubuntu.
- [Sabayon](http://distrowatch.com/sabayon) - although a bit bloated on the default ISO, this distro and I really got along, and the community was top-notch.
- [Fedora](http://distrowatch.com/fedora) - I don't think I really gave fedora the close look it deserved, but I liked what I saw for the brief time that I used it.
- [Pardus](http://distrowatch.com/pardus) - this is definitely another good one.  I just didn't "click" with it, but it was quality.

A few more that deserve mention as runners up are:<!--more-->

- [Debian](http://distrowatch.com/debian) - the big one.  I've never cared too much for older packages, even for the sake of stability, but I still have great respect for the distro!
- [Mint](http://distrowatch.com/mint) - A spin on Ubuntu...but a very good spin! (I'm usually one for disliking the "remixes")
- [Ubuntu](http://distrowatch.com/ubuntu) - itself based on Debian. very polished. I used this one for a long time before hopping and eventually settling down with Arch
- [sidux](http://distrowatch.com/sidux) - based on Debian sid. I liked this one but not enough to stay with it for very long.

So there you have it, my preferences along with my very short descriptions.  Although I like for my desktop to stay stable, I may have to start hopping on one of my laptops again--I like to see what else is out there and what they all have to offer. I LOVE the sheer amount of choice that Linux and FOSS offer!
