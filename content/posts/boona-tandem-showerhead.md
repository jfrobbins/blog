# Our Shower Got an Upgrade: The Boona Tandem Shower Head Experience

## Introduction

When I first heard about the [Boona Tandem Shower Head](https://boona.com/products/tandem), it was through a meme about its Shark Tank appearance. Intrigued by the concept, I decided to give it a shot when I saw it on sale (around $230, vs the usual $250). Here's how it changed our daily shower routine.

## Why We Love It

**Easy Installation:** Seriously, it took about 10 minutes to set up. No tools, no drilling - just a simple tension mount. It's perfect if you're renting or just hate the idea of a big bathroom project. 

**Dual Shower Heads:** This is a game changer for us. My wife and I can now shower together without the usual water dance. Both heads have adjustable settings so you can get that perfect shower feel, whether you want a gentle rain or a more invigorating spray.

**Saves Water and Time:** Not only does it cut down our water bill since we're showering together more often, but it also gives us a much-needed moment to catch up on our days. It's like a little daily date to reconnect.

**Quality and Design:** You can tell this thing is well-made. Even with both heads on, the water pressure doesn't disappoint. However, I made a small mistake with the color - I thought my hardware was antique bronze so I ordered the "midnight black" Boona, only to realize that our hardware is actually a mix of chrome and satin nickel. As we slowly upgrade our bathroom, we'll match our hardware to the shower head. At least the dual-showerhead setup is already sorted!

## Real-Life Use

The meme was interesting from the investment perspective, but the product? It's legit. I didn't expect much from a product that was once on Shark Tank, but the Boona Tandem Shower Head has exceeded expectations. It's become one of those purchases I'm genuinely happy about.

This is not an ad, and I don't get paid anything for mentioning this at all -- I just think it is a great product (which is harder and harder to come across, it seems).

## The Good and the Not-So-Good

**Pros:**
- **DIY Friendly:** No need to call a plumber - you can do this yourself.
- **Couple's Delight:** Turns a shower into a shared experience, enhancing our time together.
- **Eco-Friendly:** Reduces water usage when showering together.
- **Aesthetically Pleasing:** Comes in various colors to fit your bathroom's style, once you get the color right!

**Cons:**
- **Space:** Needs walls spaced 56 to 76 inches apart. If your shower is outside these dimensions, you might need extra fittings.
- **Water Pressure:** If your home already struggles with water pressure, using both heads might be a bit less satisfying.
- **Price:** At $250, it's not an impulse buy, but the quality and experience might justify the cost for many.

## Interesting Boona Facts

- **Behind the Product:** Created by former Amazon engineers who wanted to foster real-world connections through simple innovations. 
- **Crowdfunding Hit:** Their [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/boonas/tandem-dual-shower-head) was a massive success, showing there was indeed a market for this idea.

## Conclusion

The Boona Tandem Shower Head has genuinely transformed our shower routine into something special. If you're considering a bathroom upgrade but dread the thought of renovation, this might be the answer. It's not just about the shower; it's about the moments it creates.
