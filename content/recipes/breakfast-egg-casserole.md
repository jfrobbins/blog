I received this recipe from a friend, and it sounds good.

[Source: bonappetit.com](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/breakfast-casserole)

## Ingredients:
- **1 pound hot and/or sweet Italian sausage, casings removed**
- **2 medium red bell peppers, stemmed, seeded, and thinly sliced**
- **2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil**
- **1 large onion, thinly sliced**
- **6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced**
- **8 large eggs**
- **2 cups whole milk**
- **2 teaspoons kosher salt**
- **2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper**
- **1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional for heat)**
- **10 cups 1-inch pieces country-style white or sourdough bread (about 1 loaf)**
- **2 cups coarsely grated Fontina or Gruyère cheese**
- **1/2 cup finely grated Pecorino or Parmesan cheese**

## Directions:

1. **Cook the Sausage and Peppers:**
   - Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. 
   - Add sausage and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until browned and cooked through, about 8 minutes.
   - Using a slotted spoon, transfer sausage to a plate, leaving as much fat in the skillet as possible.

2. **Cook Vegetables:**
   - Add bell peppers and onion to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 10 minutes.
   - Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.
   - Season with salt and pepper.

3. **Prepare the Egg Mixture:**
   - Whisk eggs, milk, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using) in a large bowl.

4. **Assemble the Casserole:**
   - Place bread in a lightly greased 13x9x2-inch baking dish.
   - Scatter sausage, then pepper mixture over bread.
   - Pour egg mixture over, pressing down on bread to submerge.
   - Cover with plastic wrap and chill at least 2 hours or up to 1 day.

5. **Bake:**
   - Preheat oven to 350°F.
   - Remove plastic wrap from casserole; sprinkle with Fontina and Pecorino.
   - Bake until top is golden brown, center is set, and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 50-60 minutes. 
   - Let casserole cool slightly before serving.

## Do Ahead:
- Breakfast casserole can be assembled 2 days ahead; keep chilled. 
- Casserole can be baked 1 day ahead; reheat in a 350° oven until warmed through.
