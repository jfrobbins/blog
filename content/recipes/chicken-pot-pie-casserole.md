## Ingredients

- 1 lb chicken breast, cubed
- 12 oz frozen peas and carrots, thawed
- 1 onion, diced
- 1 can of cream of chicken soup
- 1 can of cream of mushroom soup
- 2 cups of frozen diced potatoes, thawed
- 1 cup of water
- 2-3 pie crusts (or crescent rolls)
- 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning (alternatively use):
  - Garlic powder
  - Pepper
  - No salt seasoning (e.g., Mrs. Dash)
  - A pinch of red pepper flakes
- Salt and pepper to taste (we omit salt as there should be enough in the soups)

## Directions

1. **Preheat Oven:** Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F.

2. **Prepare Pie Crusts:** If refrigerated, allow pie crusts to come to room temperature for easier handling.

3. **Grease Baking Dish:** Grease an 11x13" baking dish.

4. **Line with Crust:** Line the bottom and sides of the baking dish with one pie crust.

5. **Pre-bake Crust:** Bake the bottom crust in the dish for about 20 minutes or follow the pie crust package instructions.

6. **Cook Filling:**
   - In a large skillet over medium heat, combine chicken, onion, water, potatoes, and peas/carrots. Cook for 10-15 minutes or until the chicken is cooked and onions are translucent.

7. **Add Soups and Seasoning:**
   - Stir in the cream of chicken and mushroom soups along with the poultry seasoning (or substitutes). Cook for another 5 minutes.

8. **Adjust Consistency:** If the sauce is too thick, add more water to reach the desired consistency.

9. **Assemble Casserole:**
   - Pour the chicken mixture over the pre-baked pie crust in the baking dish.

10. **Top with Crust:**
    - Cover the filling with another pie crust. You might need to piece together multiple crusts to cover the dish fully.

11. **Bake:** Bake for approximately 25 minutes or until the top crust is golden brown.

**Note:** 
- The salt is omitted in this recipe primarily for health reasons. Reducing salt intake can help lower blood pressure, decrease the risk of heart disease, and improve overall cardiovascular health. The natural salt content from the canned soups should provide enough flavor without the need for additional salt.[](https://www.thecmhs.com/holay4/blue-salt-trick.html)[](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/health-benefits-cutting-salt)

**Note:** Adjust baking time if necessary to ensure the crust is golden and the filling is hot throughout.
