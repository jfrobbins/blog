# Classic Deviled Eggs
I started with [this recipe from Southern Living](https://www.southernliving.com/recipes/classic-deviled-eggs). 
With our chickens laying a plethora of eggs, I've been making deviled eggs a lot lately for functions, tweaking the recipe to my liking.


## Ingredients:
- 12 large eggs
- 4 to 6 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 4 teaspoons _spicy brown_ mustard
- 2 to 3 teaspoons pepper 
- Paprika (optional, but not really)

## Instructions:

1. **Cook Eggs (Martha Stewart Method):**
   - Place eggs in a single layer at the bottom of a pot. Add enough water to cover the eggs by at least 1 inch.
   - Set the burner to high and bring the water to a roiling boil.
   - Once boiling, cover the pot, turn off the burner, and set a timer for 12 minutes.

2. **Move Eggs to Ice Bath:**
   - After 12 minutes, use the lid to keep the eggs from escaping and very carefully pour out the hot water as much as possible. 
   - Run cold tap water over the eggs and add ice. 
   - Let sit at least 5 minutes in the ice bath.

3. **Peel Eggs:**
   - Remove egg shells. 
   - You can gently crack the shell all over and run water over the egg to help the shell come off easily.
   - Hint: on the tip or bottom side of the egg there is usually an air bubble so you can crush that area for a good starting peeling point.

4. **Halve Eggs:**
   - Split each egg lengthwise, and carefully scoop out the yolks into a bowl, leaving the egg whites intact.
   - I line the yolk-less egg whites up in my storage container that the deviled eggs will end up in.

5. **Prepare Filling:**
   - Mash the yolks with a fork. 
   - Add mayonnaise, mustard, and pepper. 
   - Stir until well combined.

6. **Fill Eggs:**
   - Spoon or pipe about 1 tablespoon of the yolk mixture into each egg white half.
     - Piping is preferable for the fancy factor.
   - I don't measure it but I start with "enough" on each egg and then go back around to use any remaining to ensure there is enough to go around.

7. **Garnish:**
   - Sprinkle with paprika if desired, for a classic look and a hint of smokiness. (definitely do this)

8. **Serve:**
   - Serve immediately, or store covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

**Notes:** 
- For the creamiest filling, you can process the yolks in a food processor.
- Be cautious with the amount of pepper; 4 teaspoons might be quite potent. Adjust according to taste.
