# Slow Cooker Thai Chicken Soup
[Source: foodiecrush.com](https://www.foodiecrush.com/slow-cooker-thai-chicken-soup/)

**Ingredients:**
- 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and finely chopped (optional for heat)
- 3 tablespoons red Thai curry paste (I usually use the entire small jar)
- 1 can (14 ounces) coconut milk
- 4 cups chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons fish sauce
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- Juice from 1 lime
- 8 ounces mushrooms, sliced
- 2 cups baby spinach or kale
- Cilantro for garnish
- Green onions, sliced, for garnish
- Lime wedges for serving

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Chicken:**
   - Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces.

2. **Sauté Aromatics:**
   - Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and ginger, cooking until the onion is translucent, about 3-4 minutes.

3. **Combine Ingredients in Slow Cooker:**
   - Transfer the sautéed mixture to the slow cooker.
   - Add the diced red bell pepper, jalapeño (if using), red Thai curry paste, coconut milk, chicken broth, fish sauce, and brown sugar. Stir well to combine.

4. **Cook:**
   - Place the chicken pieces into the slow cooker.
   - Cover and cook on low for 6 hours or on high for 3 hours.

5. **Add Final Ingredients:**
   - About 30 minutes before serving, add the mushrooms and spinach or kale to the slow cooker. Stir to combine.

6. **Finish and Serve:**
   - Just before serving, stir in the lime juice.
   - Taste and adjust seasoning with additional fish sauce or salt if needed.
   - Serve hot, garnished with cilantro, green onions, and lime wedges on the side for squeezing over the soup.

**Notes:**
- For a vegetarian version, omit the chicken and use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.
- If you prefer a thicker soup, you can blend a portion of it or add a cornstarch slurry (mix 1 tablespoon cornstarch with 1 tablespoon cold water) in the last 30 minutes of cooking.
- Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days or freeze for up to 3 months.
