## Ingredients

- 1-1.5 lbs ground beef or turkey
- 1 cup onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes
- 1 (16 oz) package frozen mixed vegetables, thawed
- 1/2 cup low-sodium beef broth
- 2 tsp Italian seasoning
- 1 tsp salt, divided
- 1/2 tsp pepper, divided
- 1.5 lbs baking potatoes, cubed
- 5 tbsp 2% milk

## Directions

1. **Preheat Oven:** Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F.

2. **Prepare Potatoes:** Boil the cubed potatoes until soft, then mash them with the milk and half of the salt and pepper.

3. **Cook the Meat:**
   - In a large saucepan or skillet, cook the ground beef or turkey until browned. Drain the grease (we recommend saving it in an old jar under the sink for disposal once it's full or too gross).

4. **Add Aromatics:** Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the pan. Cook for 3-5 minutes until the onions are soft.

5. **Combine Ingredients:**
   - Stir in the diced tomatoes, thawed mixed vegetables, beef broth, Italian seasoning, and the remaining half of the salt and pepper.

6. **Simmer:** Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and let simmer for a few minutes to blend the flavors.

7. **Prepare for Baking:**
   - Grease a 2 1/2-quart casserole dish.
   - Pour or scoop the meat mixture into the dish.

8. **Top with Potatoes:** Spread the mashed potatoes evenly over the meat mixture.

9. **Bake:** Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes or until the potato topping turns golden brown.

**Note:** 
- Ensure the meat mixture is hot and bubbling before adding the mashed potato layer to prevent a soggy pie.

- Adjust seasoning to taste before baking, as the flavors can meld differently in the oven.
