**Time:** 35 minutes

## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 lb Italian sausage, casings removed
- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 lb carrots, peeled (optional) and sliced
- 15 oz can stewed tomatoes (with juices)
- 1/2 tsp dried basil
- 1/2 tsp dried oregano
- Freshly cracked pepper, to taste
- 3 cups vegetable broth
- 3 cups water
- 12-16 oz cheese or cheese and spinach tortelloni
- 1/4 lb fresh baby spinach (approximately 2 bags)

## Directions

1. **Brown the Sausage:** Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the sausage, breaking it apart with a spoon, and sauté until browned.

2. **Cook Aromatics:** Add the diced onion and minced garlic to the pot. Continue to sauté until the onions are soft and transparent.

3. **Add Carrots:** Stir in the sliced carrots and cook for a few minutes.

4. **Add Tomatoes and Seasoning:** Pour in the stewed tomatoes with their juices, basil, oregano, and a few cracks of fresh pepper. Stir to combine.

5. **Simmer the Soup:** Add the vegetable broth and water. Cover the pot with a lid, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil.

6. **Cook Tortelloni:** Once boiling, add the tortelloni to the pot. Continue to boil until the tortelloni is tender, about 8 minutes or according to package instructions.

7. **Wilt Spinach:** Turn off the heat, add the baby spinach, and stir until the spinach is wilted and well mixed into the soup.

8. **Season:** Taste the soup and adjust seasoning if necessary. Note, we omit salt for health reasons.

9. **Serve:** Slice a French baguette and serve alongside the soup for dipping.

**Note:** 
- If you prefer, you can peel the carrots for a smoother texture, but this is optional.
- This soup keeps well, and flavors can deepen if refrigerated overnight, making it even better the next day.
