This is probably our most beloved dinner option. 
Delicious, easy to prepare, and with ingredients almost always stocked in the pantry, it's a staple and a go-to.

## Ingredients

- 1 lb ground turkey meat
- 1 can (15 oz) corn, no salt added
- 1 can (15 oz) dark red kidney beans, no salt added
- 1 can (15 oz) great northern (white) beans, no salt added
- 1 can (10 oz) Rotel
- 1 can (15 oz) pinto beans, no salt added
- 1 can (15 oz) black beans, no salt added
- 1 onion (white, red, or yellow, based on preference or availability), chopped
- 1 tbsp black pepper (modify to taste)
- 1 tbsp minced garlic (or substitute with garlic powder if necessary)
- 1 tbsp dark chili powder (modify to taste)
- 4 tbsp ranch dressing powder or one packet (or substitute with additional garlic powder or an alternate mixture)
- 4 cups (1 carton) chicken stock
- 1 tbsp crushed red pepper (modify to taste)
- 1/3 cup taco seasoning (modify to taste, add more as preferred)
- 1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms (optional)

**Notes:** 
- All cans should be "no salt added" when available.
- All cans are standard 15 oz unless otherwise specified.

## Directions

1. **Prepare the Pot:** Lightly oil the bottom of a large or medium pot and warm it over medium heat.

2. **Brown the Meat:** Add the ground turkey to the pot, breaking it apart with a spoon, and cook until browned.

3. **Sauté Onion:** Add the chopped onion to the pot. Sauté until the onion becomes transparent.

4. **Add Mushrooms:** If using, add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and start to brown.

5. **Combine Ingredients:** Stir in the corn, beans, Rotel, and all seasonings.

6. **Cook the Soup:**
   - Stir regularly to prevent the ingredients from sticking or burning at the bottom of the pot.
   - Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer until you're ready to serve.

7. **Serve:** Ladle the soup into bowls. Optionally, top with shredded cheese.

8. **Accompaniment:** Serve with tortilla chips for added texture and flavor.

**Note:** 
- Adjust the seasonings to taste as this recipe has noted modifications. This soup is very forgiving and can be tailored to your preference for spice and flavor.
- The addition of mushrooms can add another layer of texture and flavor to the soup, but they are entirely optional based on preference.
