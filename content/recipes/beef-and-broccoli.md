## Ingredients

- 2/3 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
- 1/2 cup chicken stock
- 1/4 cup honey
- 2 tbsp rice vinegar
- 2 tbsp brown sugar, packed
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp cornstarch
- 1 tsp sriracha
- 1 tsp ground ginger
- 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
- 1 tbsp sesame seed oil
- 1 pound flank steak, thinly sliced against the grain
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 2-3 heads of broccoli, cut into florets
- 1 1/4 cup water

## Directions

1. **Prepare Sauce:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, chicken stock, honey, vinegar, brown sugar, garlic, sesame seed oil, cornstarch, sriracha, ginger, red pepper flakes, and 1/4 cup of the water. Set aside.

2. **Cook Steak:**
   - Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat.
   - Add the sliced flank steak to the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the steak is browned, about 3-4 minutes.

3. **Add Broccoli and Sauce:**
   - Stir in the broccoli florets and the prepared sauce mixture into the skillet with the steak.
   - Continue cooking, stirring frequently, until the broccoli is tender and the sauce has thickened, about 3-4 more minutes. If the sauce becomes too thick, you can add more of the remaining water to adjust the consistency.

4. **Serve:** Serve the beef and broccoli hot, preferably over or with a side of rice.

**Note:** 
- If you prefer a less spicy dish, you can reduce or omit the sriracha and red pepper flakes according to your taste.
- Ensure the steak is sliced thinly against the grain for the best texture.
