# Crock Pot Red Curry Chicken

This is a recipe we enjoy frequently, especially during the colder months when soups are delightful.

## Ingredients

### For the Crock Pot:

- 1 4oz jar of red curry paste
- 1 12oz can of light coconut milk
- 1 12oz can of regular coconut milk
- 2 cups chicken stock
- 2 tablespoons fish sauce
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar (optional - can be halved or omitted for less sweetness)
- 2 (heaping) tablespoons peanut butter
- 1 lb chicken breast
- 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 1 red bell pepper
- 1 yellow bell pepper (can substitute with green or red bell pepper, or banana pepper)
- 1 onion
- 1 can sliced bamboo shoots (optional)
- 1 can baby corn (optional)
- 1 heaping tablespoon fresh ginger, minced
- 1 cup frozen vegetables (like peas, or a peas/green beans mix, or just green beans)
- 1 tablespoon lime juice (juice from 1 lime)
- Cilantro for garnish

### For the Side:

- Cooked rice (we prefer basmati brown rice)

## Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Chicken:** Cut both the chicken breast and thighs into thin strips, about 1 1/2 inches long.

2. **Vegetable Prep:** Slice the bell peppers into 1/2 inch slices, remove seeds, and slice the onion thinly.

3. **Combine Ingredients:** Place all ingredients (except rice and cilantro) into the crock pot.

4. **Cook:** Set the crock pot to low and let it cook for several hours until the chicken is tender and flavors are well combined.

5. **Rice:** Just before serving, prepare the rice according to package instructions or your preference.

6. **Garnish:** Before serving, sprinkle a little cilantro on top of the curry for freshness and color.

**Note:** Adjust the sweetness by modifying or eliminating the brown sugar based on your taste preference.
