title: Update free servers aren039t worth it
---

on the old site which I just transferred from (again), the MySQL db's are all jacked up and non-working,so I am back here to stay.

 I've changed about the [Code Page](/code/), gave it a little more structure.  I have yet to try to recover the lost posts from the other host.  I imagine it is going to be quite the hassle.

 In fact, they may not even be recoverable, if the databases were wiped out!  doh!

 While [X10hosting.com](http://X10hosting.com) did provide a good service at a great price, they were always overloaded, and as such always making upgrades.  this caused a LOT of downtime.  Finally, I'm just tired of it.

 Wish me some data recovery luck!
