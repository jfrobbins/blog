<h2><strong>Packages that I maintain:</strong></h2>
So far, there is only one package that I have created--This is in the A[rch User Repository](http://aur.archlinux.org/" target="_blank) (AUR).  There may be more in the future, as I come across packages I want to build.

 <ul>
<li>[heybuddy-trunk-bzr](http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=39138" target="_blank) : the heybuddy trunk builds (testing)</li>
</ul>
