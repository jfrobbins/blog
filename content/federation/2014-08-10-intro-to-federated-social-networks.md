title: Intro to Federated Social Networks
---
Not very long ago there was an opportunity at the local LUG to volunteer to do lightning talks on some subject,
and as a lightning talk is easier than a full-blown talk I decided to sign up and evangalize a bit on federated social networking.

I guess this subject is only tangentially related to Linux, but related enough to be interesting.
The main point of federation is that it is encouraged for as many people as possible to run their own nodes--
this spreads the network around and makes it function well even if some portions of the network do get down (or are shut down).

I'm not a very good speaker, especially when I am not familiar with the audience. And this was my second time visiting the LUG in 3 years or so.

[Here is the presentation](http://pub.jrobb.org/triadlug/20140722_social_networking/20140722_social_networking.odp) that I used, and [here](http://pub.jrobb.org/triadlug/20140722_social_networking/20140722_social_networking_images.tgz) is a tgz of the diagram images I created (SVG and PNG).
