###Social Networking (in order of use):###
- pump.io :  <em>[jrobb@io.jrobb.org](https://io.jrobb.org/jrobb) </em> -- my main pump
- - pump.io :  <em>[jrobb@microca.st](https://microca.st/jrobb) </em> -- my backup pump, if something goes wrong with the first
- StatusNet/GNUsocial :  <em>[jrobb@quitter.se](https://quitter.se/jrobb) </em>
- twitter: <em> [@jrobbnc](https://twitter.com/jrobbnc)</em><br>
- google+: <em> [+JonathanRobbinsNC](https://plus.google.com/+JonathanRobbinsNC/)</em><br>
- [twister](http://twister.net.co/) : <em>@jrobb</em> -- I don't use this much

###IRC:###
 **jrobb** on FreeNode (usually hanging in `#pump.io` and/or `#pump.io-offtopic`) -- I'm rarely on IRC.

### WhatsApp ###
- <em>(my phone number)</em>  -- As much as it bugs me that this isn't free software, the end-to-end encryption is nice and the userbase is pretty large.

###email: :###
  I recommend you use [gpg](http://www.gnupg.org) to send email. <br>
  Unfortunately my key is lost at this time due to a lack of proper backups and a computer failure. I need to fix that...

###BitMessage:###
- `BM-2cXfajwDHoCYegdYu2o83Uy8tY1BESzszN` -- I do not check this regularly, and I actually think I have lost this key due to above failure.
