# About Me

# About Me

Hello! I'm a husband and father who deeply values family, privacy, and freedom. Hereâ€™s a little bit about me:

- **Family First**: My love for my family is boundless, and they are my greatest joy.
  
- **Privacy Advocate**: I'm a firm believer in personal privacy and advocate for it wherever possible.

- **Freedom of Speech**: I cherish the US Constitution, particularly the freedom of speech it guarantees.

- **Patriotism**: Proudly American, I love my country but not in any extreme sense.

- **Tech Enthusiast**: 
  - A big supporter of **Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)**.
  - Fascinated by **distributed systems**, especially in the realm of social networks.
  - Intrigued by **encryption** technologies, especially how they support communication privacy and freedom of speech.

- **Outdoor Lover**: I enjoy the natural beauty of North Carolina, camping, and spending time at both the beach and mountains.

- **Travel & History**: I love to travel and explore different cultures, with a particular interest in historical contexts and ancient civilizations. And food, can't forget the food.

- **Philosophy of Freedom**: I believe in the principle that individuals should be free to do as they wish, so long as it does not harm others.

**Professional Background:**
- Over 20 years in the semiconductor industry.
- More than 25 years in software development (though these days, I'm more involved in management).
- Currently, I lead a department at a semiconductor startup, focusing on Measurements, Automation, Technology, and Operations.

Here I'm basically just posting whatever random things I come across that I either want to document for myself, document for my kids, or just have an inkling to put out there as I come across things.
