      <description>My wife was very concerned about the viability of our photos and things in the event of a house fire, or theft, or some other horrible event. I have an existing backup solution in-home, which would suffice for a drive failure or anything like that. What we have been lacking is an off-site backup, and after looking around at several options, I settled on JungleDisk. This service offers automated backups, directory syncing, and the ability to encrypt the disk and files.</description>

      <title>Making Backups</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Backups can be very important, no one wants to lose any of their data&amp;ndash;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;especially&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; if it has happened to you before.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have previously [setup my x64 desktop PC with softRAID](&lt;a href=&#34;http://factorq.net/2009/09/30/my-adventure-installing-linux-on-softraid1-part-4/%22&#34;&gt;http://factorq.net/2009/09/30/my-adventure-installing-linux-on-softraid1-part-4/&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; target=&amp;quot;_blank), so everything I have in my /home folder is mirrored across 2 drives.  However, I am not sure if I am overly paranoid, or maybe I just like to be extra secure because now I have implemented an additional backup measure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It started when I read [some of this stuff](&lt;a href=&#34;http://fqnet.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=nix&amp;amp;amp;action=display&amp;amp;amp;thread=50%22&#34;&gt;http://fqnet.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=nix&amp;amp;amp;action=display&amp;amp;amp;thread=50&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; target=&amp;quot;_blank) about backups and solutions, so I decided I should probably do something similar.  The one from distrowatch really pushed me a long though, as the [Q&amp;amp;A thing](&lt;a href=&#34;http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20100208#qa%22&#34;&gt;http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20100208#qa&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; target=&amp;quot;_blank) really made sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To start off, I began by reading the ArchWiki backup tools page: [wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Backup_Programs](&lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Backup_Programs%22&#34;&gt;http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Backup_Programs&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; target=&amp;quot;_blank).  I chose to try a few of them, I didn&amp;rsquo;t like arch-backup, backerupper didn&amp;rsquo;t really work the way I liked.  A few more just didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
