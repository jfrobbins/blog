      <description>So after doing a little work, I got the code tags to work in this blog software. Changes and etc can be found on the site: jbs.jrobb.org. Now I can post the bulk of the captcha code that I mentioned in my last post. For the full thing, just download the &amp;ldquo;jbs&amp;rdquo; software and check it out.&#xA;Terrible name, by the way: &amp;ldquo;jbs&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash;if anyone can think of something better, please let me know!</description>

      <description>So I wanted to enable the commentation on my blog, but hl&amp;ndash; does not incorporate any spam control by default.&#xA;Luckily, however, @jezra has made a post on this very same subject in the past.&#xA;Using his code adapted into my php stuffs, it appears to work perfectly!&#xA;I did go back as Jezra suggested and convert it to use a SESSION variable, I also made it change the problem more often.</description>
