      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve put my bike up for sale&amp;hellip;the ad/info/pictures are here: [jrob.co.cc/forsale/2005sv650/](http://jrob.co.cc/forsale/2005sv650/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank). Ideally this will sell so I can use the funds to fix my jeep in a more timely manner. Although I did have a pretty sweet deal worked out for a Dana 60 front and Dana 70u rear, it didn&amp;rsquo;t really appear that would work out&amp;ndash;the front was PSD, and I need DSD (without significantly more work/money). So, it looks like I am going to be going with a Dana 44 front / Ford 9&amp;quot; rear as long as we can work something out with pricing.</description>
