      <description>There are so many good distributions, it is hard to settle on just one. For me, anyway.&#xA;In the past when I&amp;rsquo;ve started hopping, I&amp;rsquo;ve almost always wound up using Fedora or some debian-based distro like Linux Mint. Then I go back and forth.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using LM for quite some time now (Debian Edition on 2 PCs, LM17 on 2 PCs) and plus Ubuntu desktop on one laptop and Ubuntu Server on my VPS and home server.</description>

      <description>A long time ago I had a friend who called himself my &amp;ldquo;arch-nemesis.&amp;rdquo; Well, I suppose we were better friends in our younger days, but at some point along the way his weirdness kind of took over. We were still friends&amp;hellip;just also pseudo-enemies, haha. Yeah, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really make any sense.&#xA;Anyway, this friend&amp;rsquo;s name was Ryan (later changed to Frederic). He is actually the person who introduced me to #linux, in the form of #RedHat version 4 or something&amp;ndash;it was still a while before they changed the name to &amp;ldquo;fedora.</description>

      <title>More backups this time in the &#34;cloud&#34;</title>

      <description>My wife was very concerned about the viability of our photos and things in the event of a house fire, or theft, or some other horrible event. I have an existing backup solution in-home, which would suffice for a drive failure or anything like that. What we have been lacking is an off-site backup, and after looking around at several options, I settled on JungleDisk. This service offers automated backups, directory syncing, and the ability to encrypt the disk and files.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve put my bike up for sale&amp;hellip;the ad/info/pictures are here: [jrob.co.cc/forsale/2005sv650/](http://jrob.co.cc/forsale/2005sv650/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank). Ideally this will sell so I can use the funds to fix my jeep in a more timely manner. Although I did have a pretty sweet deal worked out for a Dana 60 front and Dana 70u rear, it didn&amp;rsquo;t really appear that would work out&amp;ndash;the front was PSD, and I need DSD (without significantly more work/money). So, it looks like I am going to be going with a Dana 44 front / Ford 9&amp;quot; rear as long as we can work something out with pricing.</description>

      <description>So I had started this a long time ago, and forgotten all about it as I really didn&amp;rsquo;t have a use for it. Now that I have the ability to [tether](http://factorq.net/2010/07/14/tethering-on-the-moto-droid-with-easytether/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank), and I have my eeePC working again, combined with attending LUGs&amp;ndash;now I have the use for a secure tunnel.&#xA;In case you aren&amp;rsquo;t aware (I wasn&amp;rsquo;t), passwords and logins are sent in PLAIN TEXT&amp;ndash;yes, I said plain text. Nuts, huh?</description>

      <description>This is really great, and extremely easy. I have [NYBill](http://identi.ca/NYBill&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) to thank for finding out about this.&#xA;There is a tutorial from [here](http://www.debiantutorials.org/ezsurfer-blog/356-tether-a-droid-alternatives&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank), However, in case that goes away I will list the steps here (in the very likely event I forget how to connect).&#xA;EasyTether is in the Android Market (as well as an EasyTether Lite, which can&amp;rsquo;t connect to https, among other things).&#xA;Once you install and run the app, it can download the driver file which is a .</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve installed and been using [HeyBuddy](http://www.jezra.net/projects/heybuddy&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) as a client for identi.ca. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what identi.ca is&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s basically an [open source](http://linuxoutlaws.com/explanation/foss&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) [Twitter](http://twitter.com&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank), with more/better features.&#xA;This thing is great, keeps me from having to use [mustard](http://identi.ca/group/mustard&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) on my droid, or from keeping the webpage open. [Status.net](http://status.net&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) also has a desktop client, but I do not like it as well. Besides Heybuddy is &amp;ldquo;supposedly lightweight,&amp;rdquo; which is always great.</description>

      <description>Sometime back I made a post about how I backup my data. A recent thread on the crunchbang forums brought this back to mind, so I figured I should probably document my update here as well.&#xA;Nn my desktop I have 2 HDDs that are in a softRAID array (only /home is on the array). and then I have a daiyly cron script which does an rsync to backup my /home to an external eSATA HDD.</description>

      <title>My top 5 Linux Distributions and runners up</title>

      <guid>https://jrobb.org/blog/my-top-5-linux-distributions-and-runners-up/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been running [ArchLinux](&lt;a href=&#34;http://archlinux.org&#34;&gt;http://archlinux.org&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) on my desktop for a couple of years now, but these days I am getting on that computer less and less.  Little enough that I worry that my infrequency of system updates may cause some breakage.  To-date, I have not had any problems, but it could happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This desktop hosts pictures, and runs ssh, samba, and cups primarily.  So, I was considering hopping to another distro that would possibly be more stable and run for longer periods without a need for manual updates.  After some discussion on [identi.ca](&lt;a href=&#34;http://identi.ca&#34;&gt;http://identi.ca&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank), I think I will be fine staying with Arch, though&amp;ndash;I believe I can still manage to update once a month or so. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I figure I will go ahead and re-detail my top 5 favorite Linux distros while I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about it, though. These are in order of my personal preference of use from past distro-hopping adventures:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I was sitting here at home listening to the Linux adventure show podcast, I was just thinking about how mobilized everything is becoming.  The iPad is ridiculously popular, as are the android tablets and ipad clones.  Not to even mention the smartphone markets&amp;ndash;  I&amp;rsquo;m even writing this post on my iPhone!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; And the majority of my post was deleted&amp;hellip; Thanks wordpress app&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Editing with the continuation, which is going to be different since this is several hours later, and I am outside enjoying some vino and a habana.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There was a quote I saw on &lt;a href=&#34;http://identi.ca/&#34;&gt;identi.ca&lt;/a&gt; the other day, something like: &amp;ldquo;the year of the Linux desktop will be the year after the desktop dies&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Over the weekend I had some time and then decided to do something I had always wanted to do: create an http server. I was using my desktop, which runs [Arch](http://archlinux.org&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) of course, and went through several of [these links](http://fqnet.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=nix&amp;amp;amp;action=display&amp;amp;amp;thread=56&amp;amp;amp;page=1&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) and set my desktop up with Apache, PHP, and MySQL. Also, I installed vsftp as an FTP server.&#xA;I even signed up with DynDNS so that my dynamic IP can be updated to a (sub)domain and etc etc.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m glad I am not the only one that feels this way about Google:&#xA;[Anti-Google Sentiment Reaches a Tipping Point](http://www.daniweb.com/news/story262879.html&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) Since [my last topic](http://factorq.net/2010/02/22/making-backups/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) was backups, and today is Backup Awareness day, here is another post about: [http://blog.i-no.de//archives/2010/02/24/index.html#e2010-02-24T20_31_15.txt](http://blog.i-no.de//archives/2010/02/24/index.html#e2010-02-24T20_31_15.txt&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) This would be interesting to read from the beginning: [&amp;ldquo;Building an all-text Linux workstation&amp;rdquo;](http://lcorg.blogspot.com/2010/01/building-all-text-linux-workstation.html&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank), current part is part 11.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Backups can be very important, no one wants to lose any of their data&amp;ndash;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;especially&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; if it has happened to you before.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have previously [setup my x64 desktop PC with softRAID](&lt;a href=&#34;http://factorq.net/2009/09/30/my-adventure-installing-linux-on-softraid1-part-4/%22&#34;&gt;http://factorq.net/2009/09/30/my-adventure-installing-linux-on-softraid1-part-4/&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; target=&amp;quot;_blank), so everything I have in my /home folder is mirrored across 2 drives.  However, I am not sure if I am overly paranoid, or maybe I just like to be extra secure because now I have implemented an additional backup measure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It started when I read [some of this stuff](&lt;a href=&#34;http://fqnet.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=nix&amp;amp;amp;action=display&amp;amp;amp;thread=50%22&#34;&gt;http://fqnet.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=nix&amp;amp;amp;action=display&amp;amp;amp;thread=50&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; target=&amp;quot;_blank) about backups and solutions, so I decided I should probably do something similar.  The one from distrowatch really pushed me a long though, as the [Q&amp;amp;A thing](&lt;a href=&#34;http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20100208#qa%22&#34;&gt;http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20100208#qa&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; target=&amp;quot;_blank) really made sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To start off, I began by reading the ArchWiki backup tools page: [wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Backup_Programs](&lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Backup_Programs%22&#34;&gt;http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Backup_Programs&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; target=&amp;quot;_blank).  I chose to try a few of them, I didn&amp;rsquo;t like arch-backup, backerupper didn&amp;rsquo;t really work the way I liked.  A few more just didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
