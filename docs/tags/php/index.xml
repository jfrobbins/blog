      <description>My wife sells stuff on Etsy, and occasionally does some giveaway type things. She&amp;rsquo;s been using random.org, which is a great TRUE random generator site&amp;ndash;however, many of their better services are not free.&#xA;I then took it upon myself to set up a pretty decent Pseudo-random generator that can do the things that she needs to do: mainly, enter a list of names and return one who would be the &amp;ldquo;winner&amp;rdquo; of the giveaway.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend I had some time and then decided to do something I had always wanted to do: create an http server. I was using my desktop, which runs [Arch](http://archlinux.org&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) of course, and went through several of [these links](http://fqnet.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=nix&amp;amp;amp;action=display&amp;amp;amp;thread=56&amp;amp;amp;page=1&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) and set my desktop up with Apache, PHP, and MySQL. Also, I installed vsftp as an FTP server.&#xA;I even signed up with DynDNS so that my dynamic IP can be updated to a (sub)domain and etc etc.</description>
