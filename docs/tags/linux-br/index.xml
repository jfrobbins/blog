      <description>My wife was very concerned about the viability of our photos and things in the event of a house fire, or theft, or some other horrible event. I have an existing backup solution in-home, which would suffice for a drive failure or anything like that. What we have been lacking is an off-site backup, and after looking around at several options, I settled on JungleDisk. This service offers automated backups, directory syncing, and the ability to encrypt the disk and files.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I did have [Jolicloud](&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jolicloud.com/%22&#34;&gt;http://www.jolicloud.com/&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; target=&amp;quot;_blank) on my eeePC (900A), and it was fine for a while.  Actually, it was a pretty neat distro.  However when you try to install things using apt-get like a normal distro instead of through the &amp;ldquo;app cloud&amp;rdquo;, some things stop working and it goes downhil.  This, combined with me itching to hop a couple of distros let me to switch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I started out using [UNetBootin](&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;amp;ved=0CBsQFjAA&amp;amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Funetbootin.sourceforge.net%2F&amp;amp;amp;ei=mvY-TMfcPMGB8gbw3bWuCg&amp;amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFG2iJy14ueI6PKA0HBkn1cP-KoBg%22&#34;&gt;http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;amp;ved=0CBsQFjAA&amp;amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Funetbootin.sourceforge.net%2F&amp;amp;amp;ei=mvY-TMfcPMGB8gbw3bWuCg&amp;amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFG2iJy14ueI6PKA0HBkn1cP-KoBg&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; target=&amp;quot;_blank) to create a Live USB stick for [Fedora 13](&lt;a href=&#34;http://distrowatch.com/fedora%22&#34;&gt;http://distrowatch.com/fedora&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; target=&amp;quot;_blank) (LXDE), and installed on the EEE.  The eee is actually pretty well supported with Fedora, including the wireless (on the 900 model that I have, the 1100+ may be a different story).  This was okay, except that it was not optimized for the small screen, and some of the GUI prompts actually hung off of the screen.  Not to mention I was missing some &amp;ldquo;tap and click&amp;rdquo; functionality of the trackpad thing.  Total time installed&amp;hellip;. about 4 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From this point on&amp;hellip;I had a bit of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Project or Masters</title>

      <description>I had been planning to back to school to get my masters degree in Computer Science (or maybe Information Systems)&amp;ndash;Work would pay for the schooling as long as I made at least a B, and all of that would be well and good. However, it would take me 5 or 6 years to complete the program, and it would take up a lot of time.&#xA;I am now trying to decide if I would rather do that, or just undertake creating some project program or something on Linux for open source (or maybe for Android).</description>

      <description>I wrote a [little something](http://factorq.net/2010/02/20/browsers-etc/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) about browsers not too long ago, but this is in quite a bit more details and compares several different browsers:&#xA;[Review: Linux browsers, Part 1](http://www.raiden.net/articles/review_linux_browsers_part_1/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) - Arora, Chromium, Dillo, Epiphany, Firefox and Galeon. In part 2, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at HV3, Kazehakaze, Midori, and Opera&#xA;[Review: Linux browsers, Part 2](http://www.raiden.net/articles/review_linux_browsers_part_2/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) - HV3, Kazehakaze, Midori, Opera and compare test results.&#xA;I think he has inspired me to try out some of these other browsers(on my laptop, Firefox actually runs fine on my desktop, and I do prefer it&amp;hellip;for now)&amp;ndash;I am especially interested in Epiphany, Midori and Opera.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m glad I am not the only one that feels this way about Google:&#xA;[Anti-Google Sentiment Reaches a Tipping Point](http://www.daniweb.com/news/story262879.html&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) Since [my last topic](http://factorq.net/2010/02/22/making-backups/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) was backups, and today is Backup Awareness day, here is another post about: [http://blog.i-no.de//archives/2010/02/24/index.html#e2010-02-24T20_31_15.txt](http://blog.i-no.de//archives/2010/02/24/index.html#e2010-02-24T20_31_15.txt&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) This would be interesting to read from the beginning: [&amp;ldquo;Building an all-text Linux workstation&amp;rdquo;](http://lcorg.blogspot.com/2010/01/building-all-text-linux-workstation.html&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank), current part is part 11. I went back to find part 8 and then gave up, part 1 is back in time somewhere!</description>
