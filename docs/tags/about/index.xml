      <description>I started out creating websites for myself and friends on geocities and other hosts that were similar back in the day (late 90s). Gradually I learned and came across new technologies, data formats, and programming languages.&#xA;Back in the summer of 2000, I had just graduated high school, the Internet was in what I consider its &amp;ldquo;prime&amp;rdquo;, and I was running way too many websites. They were all mostly silly or pointless, and I wanted to drop them all as I thought that did not make sense and was a waste of time.</description>
