      <title>Linux vs BSD and an urge to hop</title>

      <description>So, my interest was peaked in BSD for some reason&amp;hellip;I think maybe I saw a release ([GhostBSD](http://www.ghostbsd.org/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) perhaps), and I realized that I don&amp;rsquo;t really know much about it. I have briefly used [PC-BSD](http://www.pcbsd.org/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) (which is based on [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank)) before while I was distro-hopping, but I did not get very extensive use out of it.&#xA;I started searching for information about BSD and how it relates to (GNU/)Linux, which basically led me to this post: [http://www.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I did have [Jolicloud](&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jolicloud.com/%22&#34;&gt;http://www.jolicloud.com/&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; target=&amp;quot;_blank) on my eeePC (900A), and it was fine for a while.  Actually, it was a pretty neat distro.  However when you try to install things using apt-get like a normal distro instead of through the &amp;ldquo;app cloud&amp;rdquo;, some things stop working and it goes downhil.  This, combined with me itching to hop a couple of distros let me to switch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I started out using [UNetBootin](&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;amp;ved=0CBsQFjAA&amp;amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Funetbootin.sourceforge.net%2F&amp;amp;amp;ei=mvY-TMfcPMGB8gbw3bWuCg&amp;amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFG2iJy14ueI6PKA0HBkn1cP-KoBg%22&#34;&gt;http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;amp;ved=0CBsQFjAA&amp;amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Funetbootin.sourceforge.net%2F&amp;amp;amp;ei=mvY-TMfcPMGB8gbw3bWuCg&amp;amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFG2iJy14ueI6PKA0HBkn1cP-KoBg&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; target=&amp;quot;_blank) to create a Live USB stick for [Fedora 13](&lt;a href=&#34;http://distrowatch.com/fedora%22&#34;&gt;http://distrowatch.com/fedora&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; target=&amp;quot;_blank) (LXDE), and installed on the EEE.  The eee is actually pretty well supported with Fedora, including the wireless (on the 900 model that I have, the 1100+ may be a different story).  This was okay, except that it was not optimized for the small screen, and some of the GUI prompts actually hung off of the screen.  Not to mention I was missing some &amp;ldquo;tap and click&amp;rdquo; functionality of the trackpad thing.  Total time installed&amp;hellip;. about 4 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From this point on&amp;hellip;I had a bit of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My top 5 Linux Distributions and runners up</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been running [ArchLinux](&lt;a href=&#34;http://archlinux.org&#34;&gt;http://archlinux.org&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) on my desktop for a couple of years now, but these days I am getting on that computer less and less.  Little enough that I worry that my infrequency of system updates may cause some breakage.  To-date, I have not had any problems, but it could happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This desktop hosts pictures, and runs ssh, samba, and cups primarily.  So, I was considering hopping to another distro that would possibly be more stable and run for longer periods without a need for manual updates.  After some discussion on [identi.ca](&lt;a href=&#34;http://identi.ca&#34;&gt;http://identi.ca&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank), I think I will be fine staying with Arch, though&amp;ndash;I believe I can still manage to update once a month or so. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I figure I will go ahead and re-detail my top 5 favorite Linux distros while I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about it, though. These are in order of my personal preference of use from past distro-hopping adventures:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;</description>
