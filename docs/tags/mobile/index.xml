      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I was sitting here at home listening to the Linux adventure show podcast, I was just thinking about how mobilized everything is becoming.  The iPad is ridiculously popular, as are the android tablets and ipad clones.  Not to even mention the smartphone markets&amp;ndash;  I&amp;rsquo;m even writing this post on my iPhone!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; And the majority of my post was deleted&amp;hellip; Thanks wordpress app&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Editing with the continuation, which is going to be different since this is several hours later, and I am outside enjoying some vino and a habana.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There was a quote I saw on &lt;a href=&#34;http://identi.ca/&#34;&gt;identi.ca&lt;/a&gt; the other day, something like: &amp;ldquo;the year of the Linux desktop will be the year after the desktop dies&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
