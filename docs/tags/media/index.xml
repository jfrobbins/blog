      <description>Yesterday at work I needed to send some video files, however they were huge. I used ffmpeg to transcode the files to H.265 and lowered the bitrate until they were an acceptable size &amp;ndash; I did this manually on the CLI a few times, and since there were several files in the directory I quickly tired of that.&#xA;So of course I needed a script to walk through the dir and do this for me!</description>
