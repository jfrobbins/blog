      <description>I was suspended from my vps again sometime yesterday due to going over my 3TB monthly bandwidth limit &amp;ndash; I was seeding many linux distributions, and with the fat pipes on the vps it just happened. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to be more careful in the future.&#xA;Anyway, this was a good opportunity for me to stop depending on the vps for my social networking at least, and I decided to go ahead and move my pump from the vps onto one of my home servers.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend I had some time and then decided to do something I had always wanted to do: create an http server. I was using my desktop, which runs [Arch](http://archlinux.org&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) of course, and went through several of [these links](http://fqnet.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=nix&amp;amp;amp;action=display&amp;amp;amp;thread=56&amp;amp;amp;page=1&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) and set my desktop up with Apache, PHP, and MySQL. Also, I installed vsftp as an FTP server.&#xA;I even signed up with DynDNS so that my dynamic IP can be updated to a (sub)domain and etc etc.</description>
