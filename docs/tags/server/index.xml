      <description>I was suspended from my vps again sometime yesterday due to going over my 3TB monthly bandwidth limit &amp;ndash; I was seeding many linux distributions, and with the fat pipes on the vps it just happened. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to be more careful in the future.&#xA;Anyway, this was a good opportunity for me to stop depending on the vps for my social networking at least, and I decided to go ahead and move my pump from the vps onto one of my home servers.</description>

      <title>My top 5 Linux Distributions and runners up</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been running [ArchLinux](&lt;a href=&#34;http://archlinux.org&#34;&gt;http://archlinux.org&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) on my desktop for a couple of years now, but these days I am getting on that computer less and less.  Little enough that I worry that my infrequency of system updates may cause some breakage.  To-date, I have not had any problems, but it could happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This desktop hosts pictures, and runs ssh, samba, and cups primarily.  So, I was considering hopping to another distro that would possibly be more stable and run for longer periods without a need for manual updates.  After some discussion on [identi.ca](&lt;a href=&#34;http://identi.ca&#34;&gt;http://identi.ca&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank), I think I will be fine staying with Arch, though&amp;ndash;I believe I can still manage to update once a month or so. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I figure I will go ahead and re-detail my top 5 favorite Linux distros while I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about it, though. These are in order of my personal preference of use from past distro-hopping adventures:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;</description>

      <description>Over the weekend I had some time and then decided to do something I had always wanted to do: create an http server. I was using my desktop, which runs [Arch](http://archlinux.org&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) of course, and went through several of [these links](http://fqnet.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=nix&amp;amp;amp;action=display&amp;amp;amp;thread=56&amp;amp;amp;page=1&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) and set my desktop up with Apache, PHP, and MySQL. Also, I installed vsftp as an FTP server.&#xA;I even signed up with DynDNS so that my dynamic IP can be updated to a (sub)domain and etc etc.</description>
