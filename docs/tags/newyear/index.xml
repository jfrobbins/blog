      <description>So, I wrote a quick script to parse through the Wordpress XML dump file and extract all of the posts into an hlscript/hl&amp;ndash; HTML type format. This turned out to be VERY easy, and pretty quick to do. I&amp;rsquo;ve now already imported all of these posts into this blog, and now I will move the factorq.net domain over here whenever I have time. My goal is to have jrobb.org and factorq.</description>

He turned 2 years old today, and for the next week or so, he and my daughter are the same age (then she turns 3, of course).&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m updating this blog from my chair, on my laptop, trying to catch up on LinuxOutlaws podcasts which I am listening to on my Droid phone (I am still at least 10 episodes behind).</description>
