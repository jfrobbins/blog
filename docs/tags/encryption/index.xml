      <description>Work has been very crazy for the past few weeks, so I haven&amp;rsquo;t had much of a chance to update this. Unfortunately I haven&amp;rsquo;t even had a chance to even play Minecraft. Although I did manage to log in and convert my local worlds to the new format, but that&amp;rsquo;s about the extent of it.&#xA;So a while back I received an eeePC 900a from a friend who owed me $25.</description>

      <description>So I had started this a long time ago, and forgotten all about it as I really didn&amp;rsquo;t have a use for it. Now that I have the ability to tether, and I have my eeePC working again, combined with attending LUGs&amp;ndash;now I have the use for a secure tunnel.&#xA;In case you aren&amp;rsquo;t aware (I wasn&amp;rsquo;t), passwords and logins are sent in PLAIN TEXT&amp;ndash;yes, I said plain text. Nuts, huh?</description>
