      <description>As I continue to go through and find old stuff that I&amp;rsquo;d done, I found this one. I wrote this simple script a while back to convert some digital comic books into a format that I could read on my Kindle e-reader.&#xA;Download Source File:&#xA;cbr_to_cbz.py github gist: https://gist.github.com/jfrobbins/442a27f798219f78b3da #!/usr/bin/env python # Author: Jon Robbins # License: GPL3+ # based on the idea from https://trisquel.info/en/wiki/how-convert-comic-book-archives-cbrcbr-cbz # # This script recursively loops through directories below a starting point and converts all cbr file to cbz files # # requires: # - unrar # - zip/unzip # # gist: https://gist.</description>

      <description>My wife sells stuff on Etsy, and occasionally does some giveaway type things. She&amp;rsquo;s been using random.org, which is a great TRUE random generator site&amp;ndash;however, many of their better services are not free.&#xA;I then took it upon myself to set up a pretty decent Pseudo-random generator that can do the things that she needs to do: mainly, enter a list of names and return one who would be the &amp;ldquo;winner&amp;rdquo; of the giveaway.</description>

      <description>So after doing a little work, I got the code tags to work in this blog software. Changes and etc can be found on the site: jbs.jrobb.org. Now I can post the bulk of the captcha code that I mentioned in my last post. For the full thing, just download the &amp;ldquo;jbs&amp;rdquo; software and check it out.&#xA;Terrible name, by the way: &amp;ldquo;jbs&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash;if anyone can think of something better, please let me know!</description>

      <title>Thoughts on Free and Open Source Software as it relates to me right now</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FOSS, or FLOSS, or F/LOSS) should be &amp;ldquo;liberally licensed to grant the right of users to use, study, change, and improve its design through the availability of its &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code&#34;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;  (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;a href=&#34;http://linuxoutlaws.com/explanation/foss&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is another description from the Linux Outlaws page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The whole idea behind this, I believe, is the availablility and portability of the source code, as well as the freedom for users to modify and distribute the code as they see fit.  All well and good, I think&amp;ndash;definitely not a bad thing, and this is something I can support.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The conundrum that I have is that for the past 4 or so years I have been programming almost exclusively in MS Visual Basic (classic, 6), with just a touch in C for micro controllers.  Only recently have we started the &lt;a href=&#34;http://factorq.net/2010/02/06/switching-code/&#34;&gt;conversion to PureBasic&lt;/a&gt;, which allows for us to compile cross-platform.  So what I am wondering is this: if I create some project using this language and free the source code with something like a GPLv3 license, would this even be valid since the compiler itself is not FOSS which could restrict distribution or other end-user freedoms and things of that sort? Would that be like the Mono projects?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If that would not &amp;ldquo;count&amp;rdquo;, or in the more likely case, if it would be shunned by the FOSS community I would rather not even waste my time.  In that event, I would much rather get out all of my old C++ books and browse some source code to brush up/re-learn what I have forgotten.  Or maybe learn Java, or Python, or&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This would be a much slower process, but if it is the &amp;ldquo;right way&amp;rdquo; then that is what I would have to do.   It isn&amp;rsquo;t like I even have a very good idea for a project anyway, just some &lt;a href=&#34;http://factorq.net/2010/07/03/project-or-masters/&#34;&gt;passing thoughts &lt;/a&gt;as arguments against going back to school&amp;ndash; So there is plenty of time for me to caught up, I am just impatient.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is the consensus here?  Is it wrong by the FOSS standards to use a non-open source compiler, for an otherwise open and free project?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
