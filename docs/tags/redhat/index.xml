      <description>A long time ago I had a friend who called himself my &amp;ldquo;arch-nemesis.&amp;rdquo; Well, I suppose we were better friends in our younger days, but at some point along the way his weirdness kind of took over. We were still friends&amp;hellip;just also pseudo-enemies, haha. Yeah, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really make any sense.&#xA;Anyway, this friend&amp;rsquo;s name was Ryan (later changed to Frederic). He is actually the person who introduced me to #linux, in the form of #RedHat version 4 or something&amp;ndash;it was still a while before they changed the name to &amp;ldquo;fedora.</description>
