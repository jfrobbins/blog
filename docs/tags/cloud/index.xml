      <description>My wife was very concerned about the viability of our photos and things in the event of a house fire, or theft, or some other horrible event. I have an existing backup solution in-home, which would suffice for a drive failure or anything like that. What we have been lacking is an off-site backup, and after looking around at several options, I settled on JungleDisk. This service offers automated backups, directory syncing, and the ability to encrypt the disk and files.</description>
