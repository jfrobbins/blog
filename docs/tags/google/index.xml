      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m glad I am not the only one that feels this way about Google:&#xA;[Anti-Google Sentiment Reaches a Tipping Point](http://www.daniweb.com/news/story262879.html&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) Since [my last topic](http://factorq.net/2010/02/22/making-backups/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) was backups, and today is Backup Awareness day, here is another post about: [http://blog.i-no.de//archives/2010/02/24/index.html#e2010-02-24T20_31_15.txt](http://blog.i-no.de//archives/2010/02/24/index.html#e2010-02-24T20_31_15.txt&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) This would be interesting to read from the beginning: [&amp;ldquo;Building an all-text Linux workstation&amp;rdquo;](http://lcorg.blogspot.com/2010/01/building-all-text-linux-workstation.html&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank), current part is part 11. I went back to find part 8 and then gave up, part 1 is back in time somewhere!</description>

      <description>I had used[ firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) for a long time, and then recently started using [chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank) / [chromium](http://code.google.com/chromium/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank). It is nice in that it is faster, and load times are good. however, it seems that it cannot properly render some sites (they are few, but they are important!). I guess I need to say that IE is just terrible (although it is the best one ever), but really isn&amp;rsquo;t even an option in my opinion.</description>
