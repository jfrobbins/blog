      <description>My wife was very concerned about the viability of our photos and things in the event of a house fire, or theft, or some other horrible event. I have an existing backup solution in-home, which would suffice for a drive failure or anything like that. What we have been lacking is an off-site backup, and after looking around at several options, I settled on JungleDisk. This service offers automated backups, directory syncing, and the ability to encrypt the disk and files.</description>

      <description>Sometime back I made a post about how I backup my data. A recent thread on the crunchbang forums brought this back to mind, so I figured I should probably document my update here as well.&#xA;Nn my desktop I have 2 HDDs that are in a softRAID array (only /home is on the array). and then I have a daiyly cron script which does an rsync to backup my /home to an external eSATA HDD.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m glad I am not the only one that feels this way about Google:&#xA;Anti-Google Sentiment Reaches a Tipping Point Since my last topic was backups, and today is Backup Awareness day, here is another post about: http://blog.i-no.de//archives/2010/02/24/index.html#e2010-02-24T20_31_15.txt This would be interesting to read from the beginning: &amp;ldquo;Building an all-text Linux workstation&amp;rdquo;, current part is part 11. I went back to find part 8 and then gave up, part 1 is back in time somewhere!</description>

      <title>Making Backups</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Backups can be very important, no one wants to lose any of their data&amp;ndash;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;especially&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; if it has happened to you before.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have previously &lt;a href=&#34;http://factorq.net/2009/09/30/my-adventure-installing-linux-on-softraid1-part-4/&#34;&gt;setup my x64 desktop PC with softRAID&lt;/a&gt;, so everything I have in my /home folder is mirrored across 2 drives.  However, I am not sure if I am overly paranoid, or maybe I just like to be extra secure because now I have implemented an additional backup measure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It started when I read &lt;a href=&#34;http://fqnet.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=nix&amp;amp;action=display&amp;amp;thread=50&#34;&gt;some of this stuff&lt;/a&gt; about backups and solutions, so I decided I should probably do something similar.  The one from distrowatch really pushed me a long though, as the &lt;a href=&#34;http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20100208#qa&#34;&gt;Q&amp;amp;A thing&lt;/a&gt; really made sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To start off, I began by reading the ArchWiki backup tools page: &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Backup_Programs&#34;&gt;wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Backup_Programs&lt;/a&gt;.  I chose to try a few of them, I didn&amp;rsquo;t like arch-backup, backerupper didn&amp;rsquo;t really work the way I liked.  A few more just didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
