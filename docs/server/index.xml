      <description>I was suspended from my vps again sometime yesterday due to going over my 3TB monthly bandwidth limit &amp;ndash; I was seeding many linux distributions, and with the fat pipes on the vps it just happened. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to be more careful in the future.&#xA;Anyway, this was a good opportunity for me to stop depending on the vps for my social networking at least, and I decided to go ahead and move my pump from the vps onto one of my home servers.</description>
