      <p>I had been planning to back to school to get my masters degree in Computer Science (or maybe Information Systems)&ndash;Work would pay for the schooling as long as I made at least a B, and all of that would be well and good.  However, it would take me 5 or 6 years to complete the program, and it would take up a lot of time.</p>
<p>I am now trying to decide if I would rather do that, or just undertake creating some project program or something on Linux for open source (or maybe for Android).  I&rsquo;ve wanted to be more involved in FOSS for a long time, and if I did start this project it would be me &ldquo;giving back&rdquo; something.  But I&rsquo;m not incredibly creative&hellip;I would be terrible at making a podcast and things of that sort, and I am not a very good blogger (yes, I realize this).  I do have some sort of ability to do some programming, and a desire to learn in that area so I guess that is where I am heading.</p>
<p>Now, the obvious problem with such a project&hellip;.I have NO IDEA what i is I would like to do. I could create my own distribution, but I don&rsquo;t see much added value for that. Just a lot of work!  But I have always wanted to try <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/">Linux From Scratch</a>.</p>
<p>Or I could make some kind of <a href="http://identi.ca">identi.ca</a> client: mobile like <a href="http://mustard.macno.org/">mustard</a> or maybe something desktop like <a href="http://mustard.macno.org/planet/identica">HeyBuddy</a>.    Or maybe I could start out with some kind of project like this, and then see where I go from there.  I am definitely not thinking that whatever I do will take off and be tremendously popular or anything, but I guess it could happen.</p>
<p>I think I will start reading up on the identi.ca API and see what needs to be done, then can work something out!</p>
