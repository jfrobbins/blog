  <meta name="twitter:description" content="I’ve been running ArchLinux on my desktop for a couple of years now, but these days I am getting on that computer less and less. Little enough that I worry that my infrequency of system updates may cause some breakage. To-date, I have not had any problems, but it could happen.
This desktop hosts pictures, and runs ssh, samba, and cups primarily. So, I was considering hopping to another distro that would possibly be more stable and run for longer periods without a need for manual updates. After some discussion on identi.ca, I think I will be fine staying with Arch, though–I believe I can still manage to update once a month or so. :-)
I figure I will go ahead and re-detail my top 5 favorite Linux distros while I’m thinking about it, though. These are in order of my personal preference of use from past distro-hopping adventures:
Arch …naturally! CrunchBang - I liked this one a lot the last time I tried it, and apparently now it is based off Debian instead of Ubuntu. Sabayon - although a bit bloated on the default ISO, this distro and I really got along, and the community was top-notch. Fedora - I don’t think I really gave fedora the close look it deserved, but I liked what I saw for the brief time that I used it. Pardus - this is definitely another good one. I just didn’t “click” with it, but it was quality. A few more that deserve mention as runners up are:">

      <p>I&rsquo;ve been running <a href="http://archlinux.org">ArchLinux</a> on my desktop for a couple of years now, but these days I am getting on that computer less and less.  Little enough that I worry that my infrequency of system updates may cause some breakage.  To-date, I have not had any problems, but it could happen.</p>
<p>This desktop hosts pictures, and runs ssh, samba, and cups primarily.  So, I was considering hopping to another distro that would possibly be more stable and run for longer periods without a need for manual updates.  After some discussion on <a href="http://identi.ca">identi.ca</a>, I think I will be fine staying with Arch, though&ndash;I believe I can still manage to update once a month or so. :-)</p>
<p>I figure I will go ahead and re-detail my top 5 favorite Linux distros while I&rsquo;m thinking about it, though. These are in order of my personal preference of use from past distro-hopping adventures:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/arch">Arch</a> &hellip;naturally!</li>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/crunchbang">CrunchBang</a> - I liked this one a lot the last time I tried it, and apparently now it is based off Debian instead of Ubuntu.</li>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/sabayon">Sabayon</a> - although a bit bloated on the default ISO, this distro and I really got along, and the community was top-notch.</li>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/fedora">Fedora</a> - I don&rsquo;t think I really gave fedora the close look it deserved, but I liked what I saw for the brief time that I used it.</li>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/pardus">Pardus</a> - this is definitely another good one.  I just didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;click&rdquo; with it, but it was quality.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few more that deserve mention as runners up are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/debian">Debian</a> - the big one.  I&rsquo;ve never cared too much for older packages, even for the sake of stability, but I still have great respect for the distro!</li>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/mint">Mint</a> - A spin on Ubuntu&hellip;but a very good spin! (I&rsquo;m usually one for disliking the &ldquo;remixes&rdquo;)</li>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/ubuntu">Ubuntu</a> - itself based on Debian. very polished. I used this one for a long time before hopping and eventually settling down with Arch</li>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/sidux">sidux</a> - based on Debian sid. I liked this one but not enough to stay with it for very long.</li>
</ul>
<p>So there you have it, my preferences along with my very short descriptions.  Although I like for my desktop to stay stable, I may have to start hopping on one of my laptops again&ndash;I like to see what else is out there and what they all have to offer. I LOVE the sheer amount of choice that Linux and FOSS offer!</p>
