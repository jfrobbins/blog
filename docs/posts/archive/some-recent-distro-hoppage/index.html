So I started out using UNetBootin to create a Live USB stick for Fedora 13 (LXDE), and installed on the EEE. The eee is actually pretty well supported with Fedora, including the wireless (on the 900 model that I have, the 1100&#43; may be a different story). This was okay, except that it was not optimized for the small screen, and some of the GUI prompts actually hung off of the screen. Not to mention I was missing some “tap and click” functionality of the trackpad thing. Total time installed…. about 4 hours.
From this point on…I had a bit of trouble.">

      <p>I did have <a href="http://www.jolicloud.com/">Jolicloud</a> on my eeePC (900A), and it was fine for a while.  Actually, it was a pretty neat distro.  However when you try to install things using apt-get like a normal distro instead of through the &ldquo;app cloud&rdquo;, some things stop working and it goes downhil.  This, combined with me itching to hop a couple of distros let me to switch.</p>
<p>So I started out using <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CBsQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Funetbootin.sourceforge.net%2F&amp;ei=mvY-TMfcPMGB8gbw3bWuCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFG2iJy14ueI6PKA0HBkn1cP-KoBg">UNetBootin</a> to create a Live USB stick for <a href="http://distrowatch.com/fedora">Fedora 13</a> (LXDE), and installed on the EEE.  The eee is actually pretty well supported with Fedora, including the wireless (on the 900 model that I have, the 1100+ may be a different story).  This was okay, except that it was not optimized for the small screen, and some of the GUI prompts actually hung off of the screen.  Not to mention I was missing some &ldquo;tap and click&rdquo; functionality of the trackpad thing.  Total time installed&hellip;. about 4 hours.</p>
<p>From this point on&hellip;I had a bit of trouble.</p>
<p>I now realize that my problems had a LOT to do with the drives I was using, and drive order on boot, etc.  The main drive of my EEE is a 4GB SSD.  I also have a 2GB SD card in the reader, which I intended to use as /home.  and then, the USB media was another drive (when one was used).</p>
<p>I have a cd-r with <a href="http://distrowatch.com/crunchbang">CrunchBang</a> 10 Alpha 2 &ldquo;Statler&rdquo; (which I run on my other laptop), so since this release does not play nicely with live USB media, I hooked up my slim CD/DVD RW USB drive and booted the cd-r I had previously burned. Somehow, this got completely messed up and would not boot after install.  after trying to fix it for a bit, I gave up, and then I moved onto&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="http://distrowatch.com/slitaz">SLiTaz</a>.  This is a very small distro, about 30mb, which I ran from a USB stick.  On boot, it installs entirely into the RAM and is extremely quick.  This is much like Puppy Linux, however there is a root and standard user (<a href="http://distrowatch.com/puppy">Puppy</a> only has root&hellip;or that was the case the last time I used it, anyway).  I installed this to the disk, using the same setup with /(root) /home and swap partitions between the SSD and SD card. This setup would almost boot, but no kernel found&ndash; so I just edited the GRUB prompt and got it to boot no problem.  Then, however, I could not log in as my standard user!  I could log in as root, and change passwords and anything else&ndash; I even removed and re-added my standard user, and still could not log in.</p>
<p>At this point, I was even more frustrated.  I decided to try CrunchBang Statler ONE more time.  Hooked up the USB CD drive again and reinstalled.  However THIS time I just installed all to the SSD.  worked like a charm.  After the install was setup, I got the UUID for the SD card and modified my /etc/fstab to mount it as /home.  Voila!  Everything working like a champ.</p>
<p>Also, in #! 10, the trackpad works terrifically!  Tap and click, along with 2 finger scroll&ndash;which is awesome!  I like it a lot.</p>
<p>Now, this brings me back to Fedora.  I was still wanting to try this out, since I had only looked at Fedora 11 very briefly, and I had actually used Red Hat (pre-Fedora) for a while from 2000 to ~2002ish.   I have an Acer Aspire Revo (which I&rsquo;d written specifically about before but that was wiped out from the other host crashing), I decided to install Fedora13 on here to dual-boot with Windows7.</p>
<p>I first shrunk the Windows partition using <a href="http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=gparted">Gparted</a> which I installed onto the LiveUSB environment.  The install went very well, everything set up properly. I installed grub to the first sector of the /boot of Fedora, rather than to the MBR however, because of some issues I had read of involving Windows 7.  As I went to boot, it went straight to Windows without a hitch.  A problem, as I wanted to boot to Linux.  I then installed <a href="http://download.cnet.com/EasyBCD/3000-2094_4-10556865.html">EasyBCD</a> onto WIndows and added Fedora to the boot menu.  After this, it has continued to work beautifully.</p>
<p>I added <a href="http://rpmfusion.org/">RPMFusion</a> repositories for any &ldquo;Free&rdquo; or &ldquo;nonFree&rdquo; content that is not included by default in the Fedora release.  I also used the <a href="http://www.fedorafaq.org">Unofficial Fedora FAQ</a> to get flash working and some other things.</p>
<p>I downloaded the latest <a href="http://www.jezra.net/projects/heybuddy">HeyBuddy</a> RPM from <a href="http://rpm.psquid.net/">PSquid&rsquo;s site</a>.  Now I am all up to date, and doing some further exploration into Fedora.  I am liking it, so far&ndash;and I really like the LXDE interface!  I don&rsquo;t know if I would switch from Arch&hellip;But if I was switching, this would be a contender (As would CrunchBang).</p>
<p>Alright, That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got!</p>
