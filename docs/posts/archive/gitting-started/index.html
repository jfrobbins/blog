      <p>It is a bit embarassing for me to admit this, but I having been using Linux for 10ish years now, and I have never used <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> until very recently.
Sacrilege, I know!  Other version control systems I have also stayed away from&ndash;except for <a href="https://launchpad.net/">launchpad</a>/<a href="https://launchpad.net/bzr">bazaar</a>, which I used I think 3 commands but never really got into it.</p>
<p>When I started hacking into my <a href="http://jbs.jrobb.org">blog software</a>, I started realizing that some sort of version control would definitely come in handy even though it is just rather simple PHP.<br>
There are many different version controls in addition to the ones I listed above (like SVN, CVS,&hellip;it really does go on and on) but on the <a href="http://forums.linuxoutlaws.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=2995&amp;hilit=gitorious">LinuxOutlaws forum</a>, there was a discussion, but everyone seems to have a different opinion but github and gitorious were pretty well liked.
I looked around at a few of them, and decided that git looked like it makes the most sense to me.  And then I decided to go with <a href="http://gitorious.org/jbs">gitorious</a>&ndash;what can I say, it&rsquo;s a pretty cool name. :-)</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> looks good also, but apparently their framework isn&rsquo;t open source or something, which is unfortunate.  Ultimately it just comes down to user preference.</p>
<p>I thought that using git would be hard to get used to, but after a couple of days (and one of those spent perusing through <a href="http://gitref.org">gitref.org</a>), now git is second nature.  Of course&hellip;I still haven&rsquo;t done anything complicated with it&ndash;mostly just some branches/merges and lots of commits and pushes.</p>
<p>Today, as I was back at work and merging a bunch of our internal code stuff that I had edited (it is in VB6, currently), I realized that this was really just a ridiculous hassle to do manually.  If I make some improvements, I usually have to either keep track of what I change, or go through after the fact doing file compares and compiling the changes to send to the other guy to include in his code.  Not very efficient you say?  Yeah&hellip;I know.</p>
<p>This time I made use of the &ldquo;diff&rdquo; program on my cygwin shell, which made file-compare on the entire directory pretty easy.  I would have tried to use patch as well, but my co-worker had some other things that he needed to add in as well.</p>
<p>Anyway&hellip;why not use Git?!</p>
<p>I went to the Git website and downloaded a Windows version, which came with some kind of GUI that isn&rsquo;t very productive. Luckily, it installed a git bash shell, so actual use is very similar to using it on my linux machines here at home.
I then set up a remote repository on one of my backup servers, and local repository.  and bam presto! all was gravy.</p>
<p>I even set this up on another one of my computers there, so that I can merge my code no matter where I am editing it.<br>
Hopefully this will save me from a lot of wasted time. I&rsquo;m betting so, since I usually go ad try to add features a few different ways and sometimes stuff doesn&rsquo;t work out&ndash;with Git I can just delete that branch, and keep the other code intact!</p>
<p>The &ldquo;bloated software department&rdquo; uses perforce, but they haven&rsquo;t quite come to take us over yet with their .NET monstrosity.
hopefully they won&rsquo;t ever&hellip;but that&rsquo;s another story.</p>
<p>As long as I am able I will promote free and open software in my workplace (when applicable).</p>
<p>To sum up&hellip; I love Git!</p>
